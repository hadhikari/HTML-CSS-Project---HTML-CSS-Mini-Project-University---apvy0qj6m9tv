      <div class="preparation">
        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Making Spinach Puree</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Rinse the palak or spinach leaves very well in running water. Tender stem are fine. If the stems are stringy, then discard the stems.</li>
          <li>Boil 3 cups water in a pan or microwave or electric heater. Add ¼ teaspoon salt to the hot water and stir. When the water comes to a rolling boil, switch off the flame. Add the spinach leaves in the hot water. Let the palak leaves sit
            in the water for about 1 minute. </li>
          <li>Immediately add the palak or spinach leaves in a pan or bowl containing ice cold water. This method helps in preserving the green color of the spinach. Just add 8 to 10 ice cubes to 3 cups water to get cold water. Allow the spinach
            leaves to be in the cold water for a minute. </li>
          <li>Then drain the ice cold water. Add the spinach in a blender or grinder jar with chopped ginger, garlic and green chilies.</li>
          <li>Make a smooth palak puree. No need to add water while making the puree. Keep the spinach puree aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Sautéing Onions And Tomatoes</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Heat oil or ghee or butter in a pan or kadai. If using butter, melt it a low flame making sure that the butter does not brown.</li>
          <li>Add the cumin and let them splutter.</li>
          <li>Then add the tej patta or Indian bay leaf.</li>
          <li>Add the finely chopped onions. Saute till the onions become golden.</li>
          <li>Then add the finely chopped garlic. Saute till the raw aroma of garlic goes away. No need to brown the garlic.</li>
          <li>Add the chopped tomatoes. Stir and saute the tomatoes till they soften.</li>
          <li>Once the tomatoes are softened and you see fat releasing from the sides of the mixture. Then add the turmeric powder, red chili powder and asafoetida/hing.</li>
          <li>Mix very well.</li>

        </ol>
        <h3>Making Palak Paneer</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Then add the palak puree and mix well. </li>
          <li>Add about ½ cup water or as required. Mix again.</li>
          <li>Simmer for 6 to 7 minutes or more till the palak or spinach is cooked. Season with salt. The gravy or sauce will also thicken by now.</li>
          <li>Lower the heat and then add all of the powdered chole masala that we ground, together with the red chili powder, turmeric powder and garam masala powder (optional).</li>
          <li>Stir and add garam masala powder.</li>
          <li>Stir again and then add the paneer (Indian cottage cheese) cubes.</li>
          <li>Mix very well and switch off the heat. Be quick as we don't want heat the paneer for more 30 seconds to 1 minute. Overcooking paneer will make them chewy and dense.</li>
          <li>Lastly, add 2 tablespoons of low-fat cream. If using heavy whipping cream, then add 1 tablespoon of it. Stir gently again so that the cream gets incorporated in the gravy uniformly.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Serving Suggestions</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Stir and serve palak paneer hot with some roti. It also goes very well with Indian breads like tandoori roti, phulka, paratha or naan. </li>
          <li>Being a versatile dish, it also accompanies rice dishes from the indian cuisine like cumin rice, vegetable pulao, ghee rice, saffron rice and even a simple steamed rice very well. </li>
